Horizontal Magnetic Dipole over a lossy half-space

\begin{document}
We consider a two-dimensional problem of a magnetic dipole placed along the interface of free-space and lossy dielectric as illustrated in \ref{fig:setup}. The Green's function of the problem can be formulated by first expressing the magnetic line current polarized along the y-axis and located at the interface, $z = 0$:

\begin{equation}
\overrightarrow{M} = m \delta(x) \delta(z) \mathbf{y}
\label{Current}
\end{equation}

For the given problem, region in the lower half-space, $(z < 0)$ is composed of a lossy dielectric, with complex relative permittivity, $\varepsilon_1 = \varepsilon' - i \times \varepsilon''$ whereas the upper half-space, $(z > 0)$ is free space. The magnetic vector potential equations in the two regions are given as:

\begin{subequations}
	\begin{equation}
		(\nabla^2 + k_1^2) F_1 = \rho,
		\label{eq:potential_lower}
	\end{equation}
		\begin{equation}
		 \nabla\cdot{\bf H} = 0,
		\label{eq:potential_upper}
	\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
